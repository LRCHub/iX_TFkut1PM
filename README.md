[00:00.75] A long, long time ago
[00:03.74] I can still remember how that music
[00:07.70] Used to make me smile
[00:11.26] And I knew if I had my chance
[00:16.02] That I could make those people dance
[00:19.37] And maybe they'd be happy for a while
[00:37.87] 
[00:24.53] But February made me shiver
[00:29.58] With every paper I'd deliver
[00:33.01] Bad news on the doorstep
[00:36.64] I couldn't take one more step
[00:39.82] I can't remember if I cried
[00:44.81] When I read about his widowed bride
[00:49.26] Something touched me deep inside
[00:53.56] The day the music died
[01:04.56] 
[01:01.15] So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[01:08.01] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[01:13.17] And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[01:18.12] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
[01:22.39] This'll be the day that I die"
[01:37.39] 
[01:29.33] Did you write the book of love
[01:32.32] And do you have faith in God above
[01:35.77] If the Bible tells you so?
[01:40.29] Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll
[01:44.00] Can music save your mortal soul
[01:47.41] And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
[02:09.41] 
[01:53.72] Well, I know that you're in love with him
[01:58.02] 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
[02:01.70] You both kicked off your shoes
[02:05.49] Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
[02:08.17] I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck
[02:11.76] With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
[02:15.25] But I knew I was out of luck
[02:18.81] The day the music died
[02:29.81] 
[02:24.07] I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[02:28.51] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[02:32.62] Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[02:35.94] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
[02:39.24] This'll be the day that I die"
[02:54.24] 
[02:44.51] Now, for ten years we've been on our own
[02:48.05] And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
[02:51.78] But that's not how it used to be
[02:56.43] When the jester sang for the king and queen
[03:00.66] In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
[03:03.95] And a voice that came from you and me
[03:22.45] 
[03:10.29] Oh, and while the king was looking down
[03:14.42] The jester stole his thorny crown
[03:18.16] The courtroom was adjourned
[03:21.37] No verdict was returned
[03:24.45] And while Lenin read a book on Marx
[03:28.06] A quartet practiced in the park
[03:31.80] And we sang dirges in the dark
[03:35.37] The day the music died
[03:46.37] 
[03:40.13] We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[03:45.20] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[03:49.37] Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[03:52.55] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
[03:56.12] This'll be the day that I die"
[04:11.12] 
[04:01.30] Helter skelter in a summer swelter
[04:05.05] The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
[04:08.51] Eight miles high and falling fast
[04:13.37] It landed foul on the grass
[04:17.41] The players tried for a forward pass
[04:20.66] With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
[04:41.66] 
[04:26.29] Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
[04:30.19] While sergeants played a marching tune
[04:34.87] We all got up to dance
[04:38.21] Oh, but we never got the chance
[04:41.13] 'Cause the players tried to take the field
[04:45.21] The marching band refused to yield
[04:48.82] Do you recall what was revealed
[04:52.78] The day the music died?
[05:04.28] 
[04:57.31] We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[05:02.15] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[05:05.96] Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[05:09.25] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
[05:12.96] This'll be the day that I die"
[05:27.96] 
[05:18.09] Oh, and there we were all in one place
[05:21.72] A generation lost in space
[05:25.32] With no time left to start again
[05:29.63] So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
[05:33.68] Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
[05:37.43] 'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
[05:56.43] 
[05:43.50] Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
[05:47.62] My hands were clenched in fists of rage
[05:51.43] No angel born in Hell
[05:54.68] Could break that Satan spell
[05:57.87] And as the flames climbed high into the night
[06:01.55] To light the sacrificial rite
[06:05.29] I saw Satan laughing with delight
[06:08.63] The day the music died
[06:19.63] 
[06:13.87] He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[06:18.66] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[06:22.55] Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[06:25.83] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
[06:29.75] This'll be the day that I die"
[06:44.75] 
[06:35.64] I met a girl who sang the blues
[06:39.30] And I asked her for some happy news
[06:43.16] But she just smiled and turned away
[06:48.07] I went down to the sacred store
[06:51.61] Where I'd heard the music years before
[06:54.68] But the man there said the music wouldn't play
[07:17.68] 
[07:02.75] And in the streets the children screamed
[07:07.11] The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
[07:10.93] But not a word was spoken
[07:14.11] The church bells all were broken
[07:18.37] And the three men I admire most
[07:22.59] The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
[07:26.39] They caught the last train for the coast
[07:30.89] The day the music died
[07:41.89] 
[07:38.62] And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[07:45.53] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[07:51.28] And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[07:56.65] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
[08:01.34] This'll be the day that I die"
[08:16.34] 
[08:07.90] They were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[08:13.89] Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
[08:18.82] Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[08:23.08] Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
